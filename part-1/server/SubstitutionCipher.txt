Substitution Cipher is:
Define a substitution mapping that pairs each letter of the alphabet with a unique substitution letter.
For each letter in the input phrase:
If the character is a letter, replace it with its corresponding substitution letter.
If the character is not a letter, simply append it to the ciphered phrase as is.
Using the cipher, I can encipher the phrase "I love cryptography!" with a substitution mapping:
Substitution mapping:    
'A' -> ÔZ'
'B' -> ÔX'
'C' -> ÔY'
É
'Z' -> ÔAÕ
For each letter in the input phrase:
'I': Substitute with ÔR'
' ': Not a letter, so append it as is.
'l': Substitute with ÔO'
'o': Substitute with ÔL'
'v': Substitute with ÔE'
'e': Substitute with ÔV'
' ': Not a letter, so append it as is.
'c': Substitute with ÔX'
'r': Substitute with ÔI'
'y': Substitute with ÔB'
'p': Substitute with ÔK'
't': Substitute with ÔG'
'o': Substitute with ÔL'
'g': Substitute with ÔP'
'r': Substitute with ÔI'
'a': Substitute with ÔZ'
'p': Substitute with ÔK'
'h': Substitute with ÕS'
'y': Substitute with ÔB'
'!': Not a letter, so append it as is.
The ciphered phrase is "R OLEVXV XKLGLIPZI!".
To decipher, we'll reverse the substitution mapping.
Substitution mapping (reverse):
'Z' -> ÔA'
'X' -> ÔB'
'Y' -> ÔC'
É
'A' -> ÔZ'
For each letter in the ciphered phrase:
'R': Substitute with ÔI'
' ': Not a letter, so append it as is.
'O': Substitute with ÔL'
'L': Substitute with ÔO'
'E': Substitute with ÔV'
'V': Substitute with ÔE'
' ': Not a letter, so append it as is.
'X': Substitute with ÔC'
'K': Substitute with ÔP'
'L': Substitute with ÔO'
'G': Substitute with ÕT'
'P': Substitute with ÔG'
'I': Substitute with ÔR'
'Z': Substitute with ÔA'
'K': Substitute with ÔP'
'S': Substitute with ÔH'
'B': Substitute with ÔY'
'!': Not a letter, so append it as is.
The deciphered phrase is "I LOVE CRYPTOGRAPHY!".
